# Fingerprint Calculator Widget Documentation

## Overview

The **Fingerprint Calculator** widget is designed for chemoinformatics applications within the Orange data mining framework. It computes molecular fingerprints using various RDKit algorithms and provides visualizations such as histograms of fingerprint bit frequencies and PCA projections of the computed fingerprint vectors.

Fingerprints are compact, fixed-length binary representations of molecules that capture structural information. They are widely used for:
- **Similarity Searching:** Quickly comparing molecules in large databases.
- **Clustering and Classification:** Grouping similar compounds or predicting biological activities.
- **Virtual Screening:** Identifying potential drug candidates based on molecular features.

## Features

- **Multiple Fingerprint Types:**  
  - Morgan Fingerprint (default)  
  - RDKit Fingerprint  
  - MACCS Keys  
  - Atom Pair Fingerprint  
  - Topological Torsion Fingerprint  
  - Avalon Fingerprint

- **User-Defined Parameters:**  
  - Bit size (controls fingerprint resolution)  
  - Radius (for Morgan fingerprints)

- **Progress Monitoring:**  
  Displays a progress bar during the fingerprint computation to inform users of the process status.

- **Visualization Tools:**  
  - **Histogram:** View the distribution of the top 20 most frequent fingerprint bits.  
  - **PCA Projection:** Explore molecular similarities through a two-dimensional PCA projection of the fingerprint data.

## Requirements

To use this widget, ensure that you have installed:
- **Orange3:** The Orange data mining framework.  
- **RDKit:** For cheminformatics functionality.  
- **Additional libraries:** `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` for computations and plotting.

You can install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install orange3 rdkit-pypi numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

> **Note:** RDKit may require additional installation steps depending on your operating system. Please refer to the [RDKit installation guide](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html) for details.

## Usage

### Input Data

The widget expects an Orange **Table** where the first meta attribute contains molecular representations (typically in **SMILES** format). The SMILES column is used to generate the molecular objects with RDKit.

### User Interface

- **Fingerprint Settings:**  
  The settings box allows users to select the type of fingerprint, adjust the bit size, and set the radius (for Morgan fingerprints).

- **Buttons:**  
  - **Compute Fingerprint:** Initiates the fingerprint calculation on the input molecule data.  
  - **Show Histogram:** Opens a window displaying a bar chart of the top 20 most frequent fingerprint bits.  
  - **Show PCA Projection:** Opens a window displaying a 2D PCA projection of the fingerprint data.

- **Progress Bar:**  
  A progress bar is displayed during the computation to provide feedback on processing progress.

### Example

Below is an example of how you might set up a small test within Orange (or in a standalone script) using the widget:

```python
from Orange.data import Table, Domain, StringVariable
import numpy as np

# Create a simple dataset with SMILES strings in the meta column
smiles = ["CCO", "CCC", "CCN", "CCCl", "CCBr"]
# Domain with dummy feature and a meta column for SMILES
domain = Domain([], metas=[StringVariable("SMILES")])
# Create a table with no features and SMILES as meta data
data = Table.from_list(domain, [[None, s] for s in smiles])

# Assume the widget is instantiated as follows:
widget = FingerprintWidget()
widget.set_data(data)

# Compute fingerprints and visualize (these buttons call the underlying methods)
widget.compute_fingerprints()  # This will compute fingerprints with progress feedback
widget.show_histogram()        # Display histogram of fingerprint bits
widget.show_pca_projection()   # Display PCA projection of fingerprints
```

> **Tip:** In Orange, connect your molecule data source (e.g., a file reader widget) to this widget and use the provided buttons to interactively compute and visualize fingerprints.

## Importance of Molecular Fingerprints

**Molecular fingerprints** are an essential tool in chemoinformatics because they:
- **Capture Structural Information:**  
  They convert complex chemical structures into fixed-length binary vectors, simplifying downstream analysis.
- **Enable Fast Similarity Searches:**  
  Fingerprint comparisons (often using Tanimoto similarity) allow quick identification of similar compounds, a key operation in drug discovery.
- **Support Machine Learning:**  
  Fingerprint vectors serve as features in various predictive modeling tasks (e.g., predicting bioactivity, toxicity, or solubility).
- **Facilitate Clustering:**  
  By providing a standardized representation, fingerprints enable clustering of molecules into structurally or functionally related groups.

## Possible Applications

- **Drug Discovery:**  
  Rapidly screen chemical libraries to find molecules similar to known active compounds.
- **QSAR Modeling:**  
  Use fingerprints as input features in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models.
- **Chemical Database Searching:**  
  Find compounds with desired structural characteristics using similarity-based searches.
- **Chemical Diversity Analysis:**  
  Explore and visualize the chemical space of a compound library.

## Suggested Pipeline with Existing Widgets

To leverage the **Fingerprint Calculator** within a broader analysis workflow in Orange, consider the following pipeline:

1. **Data Import:**  
   Use the **File** widget or **Data Table** widget to import molecule datasets (ensure SMILES strings are included in the meta data).

2. **Fingerprint Calculation:**  
   Connect the imported data to the **Fingerprint Calculator** widget to generate fingerprint features.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Optionally, use widgets like **Preprocess** or **Select Columns** to clean and prepare the data (e.g., select relevant fingerprint features).

4. **Visualization:**  
   - **Scatter Plot** or **PCA** widget:  
     After fingerprint computation, you can use the **Scatter Plot** or **PCA** widget to visualize molecular similarities.
   - **Heatmap:**  
     Display a heatmap to visualize similarity matrices.

5. **Modeling & Analysis:**  
   - **Clustering:**  
     Use the **Hierarchical Clustering** or **k-Means** widget to cluster molecules based on their fingerprint vectors.
   - **Classification/Regression:**  
     Connect the fingerprint data to classification (e.g., **Random Forest**, **SVM**) or regression widgets for predictive modeling tasks.
   - **Association Rules:**  
     Discover associations between structural features and biological activities.

6. **Reporting:**  
   Use **Report** or **Save Data** widgets to document findings and export processed data.

This modular approach allows you to integrate chemical structure analysis seamlessly into the Orange workflow, combining the strengths of cheminformatics with data mining and visualization capabilities.
